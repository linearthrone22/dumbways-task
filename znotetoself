to overlay in html with css =
    1. z-index: The z-index property controls the stacking order of positioned elements on the z-axis (the depth or "front-to-back" order). It specifies how elements should be layered and displayed in relation to each other. Elements with a higher z-index value appear in front of elements with a lower z-index value. The z-index property only works on positioned elements, which means you need to apply a position value other than static to the element for z-index to have any effect.

    The z-index property accepts integer or keyword values. Higher values are stacked above lower values, and negative values are also allowed. If two or more elements have the same z-index, the stacking order will depend on the order in the HTML markup, with elements later in the markup stacking on top of earlier elements.

    2. position: The position property specifies the positioning method used for an element. It determines how the element is positioned within its parent or containing element. The position property works in conjunction with other CSS properties like top, bottom, left, right, and z-index to control the element's placement.

    There are four possible values for the position property:

    static (default): Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. top, bottom, left, right, and z-index have no effect.
    relative: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position. Using top, bottom, left, or right offsets, you can shift the element from its initial position without affecting the layout of other elements. z-index can also be applied to establish a stacking order within relatively positioned elements.
    absolute: Elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (parent element with a position value other than static) or the initial containing block if there's no positioned ancestor. This allows precise control over the element's position using top, bottom, left, or right offsets. z-index can be used to determine the stacking order of absolutely positioned elements.
    fixed: Elements are positioned relative to the browser window, meaning they remain in the same position even if the page is scrolled. It behaves similarly to absolute, but the positioning is fixed with respect to the viewport. z-index can also be applied to fixed positioned elements.
